(A special thanks to [@fh-d](https://github.com/fh-d) for this awesome logo !)

## Current features

* **Simple**: a command line tool to manage easily your downloads ;
* **Fast**: multithreading support.

**NOTE**: _Snatch_ is on _alpha_ version. This version runs well on remote contents with a length known **before** the download (with the `content-length` header from the server response) - also, the _Interruptable_ feature is not implemented yet.

## Installation

1. Install Rust and Cargo using [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/) ;
2. You can download two versions of _Snatch_ :  
  * the latest build from [crates.io](https://crates.io/): `cargo install
    snatch` ;
  * the last commit version from Github: `cargo install --git https://github.com/derniercri/snatch.git --branch devel` ;
3. Enjoy !
